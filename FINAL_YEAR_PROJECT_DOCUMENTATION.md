## Database Design

### 4.1 Database Schema Overview

The ASEDA system uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema designed for multi-tenant accounting operations. The schema includes 20+ tables with proper relationships, constraints, and indexes for optimal performance.

### 4.2 Core Database Tables

#### 4.2.1 Authentication and User Management

**Organizations Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name text NOT NULL,
    business_type business_type DEFAULT 'company',
    registration_number text,
    tax_number text,
    email text,
    phone text,
    address text,
    logo_url text,
    fiscal_year_start date DEFAULT '2024-01-01',
    fiscal_year_end date DEFAULT '2024-12-31',
    base_currency text DEFAULT 'GHS',
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Profiles Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    full_name text NOT NULL,
    role user_role DEFAULT 'accountant',
    organization_id uuid REFERENCES organizations(id),
    is_active boolean DEFAULT true,
    last_login timestamptz,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 4.2.2 Chart of Accounts

**Chart of Accounts Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE chart_of_accounts (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    organization_id uuid REFERENCES organizations(id),
    account_code text NOT NULL,
    account_name text NOT NULL,
    account_type account_type NOT NULL,
    description text,
    parent_id uuid REFERENCES chart_of_accounts(id),
    status text DEFAULT 'active',
    is_bank_account boolean DEFAULT false,
    current_balance numeric DEFAULT 0,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(organization_id, account_code)
);
```

#### 4.2.3 Transaction Management

**Journal Entries Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE journal_entries (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    organization_id uuid REFERENCES organizations(id),
    entry_number text NOT NULL,
    date date NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    reference text,
    description text NOT NULL,
    total_debit numeric DEFAULT 0,
    total_credit numeric DEFAULT 0,
    status text DEFAULT 'draft' CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'posted', 'cancelled')),
    created_by uuid REFERENCES profiles(id),
    posted_at timestamptz,
    posted_by uuid REFERENCES profiles(id),
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(organization_id, entry_number)
);
```

### 4.3 Database Security

#### 4.3.1 Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables implement RLS policies to ensure multi-tenant data isolation:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can access their organization data" 
ON chart_of_accounts FOR ALL 
USING (organization_id IN (
    SELECT organization_id 
    FROM profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
));
```

#### 4.3.2 Database Functions and Triggers

**Automatic Balance Updates**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_account_balance()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE chart_of_accounts SET
        current_balance = current_balance + NEW.debit_amount - NEW.credit_amount
    WHERE id = NEW.account_id;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

| Relationship | Cardinality | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Organizations → Profiles | 1:N | One org, many users |
| Organizations → Chart of Accounts | 1:N | Org-specific accounts |
| Organizations → Contacts | 1:N | Org-specific contacts |
